# :mouse: mAuth Mouse Machine Learning
**Conference Paper:** [ConferencePaper.pdf](./ConferencePaper.pdf)

This project involves the development of a proof of concept model using 
computer mouse data that could potentially be used in an authentication 
scheme. The model uses **KNN**, **SVM** (SVC), and **decision tree** algorithms to analyze 
data such as mouse position, time of the event, and button press duration. 
The goal is to determine if this data can be used to accurately identify a 
user and differentiate them from potential imposters. By exploring the 
potential of mouse data for authentication purposes, this project aims 
to contribute to the growing field of biometric authentication research.

# :floppy_disk: Data collection
- The **raw** dataset is located in the [./raw_data/](./raw_data) folder
  - The same subjects with their extracted features are in the [./synth_data/extracted_features_data/](./synth_data/extracted_features_data) folder
- To extract the features, the raw data needs to be processed from [preprocessing.py](./preprocessing.py).

Data collection is done within [collection.py](./collection.py), which utilizes the 
[pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) library to collect mouse input data. Specifically, 
we collected the UNIX timestamp of the event, X and Y positions of the event, which button was pressed, 
and how long it was pressed for.

## :mag: The Data
Here is a sample piece of data:

| ID  | Timestamp          | X    | Y   | Button | Duration             |
|-----|--------------------|------|-----|--------|----------------------|
| 2   | 1676925152.344601  | 901  | 488 | -1     | -1                   |
| 2   | 1676925152.3605819 | 915  | 482 | -1     | -1                   |
| 2   | 1676925157.8644285 | 975  | 301 | -1     | -1                   |
| 2   | 1676925158.0728395 | 975  | 301 | 1      | -1                   |
| 2   | 1676925158.1127932 | 975  | 301 | 1      | 0.03995370864868164  |
| 2   | 1676925152.368573  | 924  | 480 | -1     | -1                   |
| ... | ...                | ...  | ... | ...    | ...                  |

- **ID:** Subject ID
- **Timestamp:** UNIX Timestamp of the event
- **X, Y**: The X and Y positions of the event, where it happened on the screen
- **Button**: The button that was pressed, for this, we used the following mapping:
  - 0: Left click
  - 1: Right Click
  - 2: Middle Click
  - 3: Scrolling Down
  - 4: Scrolling Up
  - 5: Button X1 *(rarely used)*
  - 6: Button X2 *(rarely used)*
- **Duration**: The duration of the event, only used to track how long a button press event was

Button X1 and X2 were the forward/backwards buttons on mice. This wasn't useful for the game during data collection,
so will likely be cleaned out/not useful.

## :eyes: Visualization

To visualize the data, we created [a plotting script](./plot.py) to view the mouse locations.
